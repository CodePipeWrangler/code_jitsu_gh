# Consensus Sequence Finder

This script extracts a consensus sequence from a FASTA file or sequence alignment.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Biopython library

Install the Biopython library using pip:

```sh
pip install biopython

Usage

Run the script from the command line with the following syntax:

python consensus_sequence_finder.py <alignment_file> <consensus_threshold>

    <alignment_file>: Path to the input alignment file in FASTA format.
    <consensus_threshold>: A floating-point value representing the threshold for consensus determination.

Example

python consensus_sequence_finder.py example_alignment.fasta 0.4

Notes

The script reads an alignment file in FASTA format and calculates the consensus sequence based on the provided threshold.
Ensure the alignment file is properly formatted and contains valid sequence data.
